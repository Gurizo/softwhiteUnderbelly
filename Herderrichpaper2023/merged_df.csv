Reincarnation actually does occur
The concept of limits does not apply to consciousness
In order to fully understand human consciousness  a process of psychological change is necessary which may be achieved through meditation or a spiritual way of life
The accepted methods of science are the only proper way in which to investigate consciousness
Consciousness gives meaning to reality
Human consciousness would not exist without the brain
It is possible for there to be consciousness in which there is awareness but no object of awareness
Human consciousness is an emergent property of complex neural activity
